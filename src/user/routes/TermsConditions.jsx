              BEACON HOSTELS' TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            <p>
              These terms and conditions create a contract between you and
              BEACON HOSTELS. Endeavor to read them carefully.

            <h4>INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES</h4>
            <p>
              This Agreement governs your use of BEACON HOSTELS Services by
              which you can buy, get, license, and rent or subscribe to our
              content, Apps and other in-app services. Content will be offered
              through the Services by BEACON HOSTELS or a third party. Our
              Services are available for your use in UGANDA. By creating an
              account for use of the Services in a particular district or
              region, you are specifying it as your known location. To use our
              Services, you need compatible hardware, software which must be
              up-to-date and Internet access. Our Services' performance may be
              affected by these factors.

            <h3>USING OUR SERVICES</h3>
            <h5>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS</h5>
            <p>
              You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge,
              either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each
              Transaction is an electronic contract between you and BEACON
              HOSTELS. When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to
              choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future
              Transactions. On applicable hardware, if you enable finger print
              identification or Face recognition for Transactions, we will ask
              you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint or
              facial recognition. BEACON HOSTELS will charge your selected
              payment method for any paid Transactions, including any applicable
              taxes. You can associate multiple payment methods with your BEACON
              HOSTELS ID, and you agree that BEACON HOSTELS may store and charge
              those payment methods for Transactions. Your primary payment
              method appears at the top of your account settings payments page.
              If your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason
              (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize BEACON
              HOSTELS to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods
              in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account
              settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain
              responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to
              charge you again or request that you provide another payment
              method. In accordance with local law, BEACON HOSTELS may
              automatically update your payment information regarding your
              payment methods if provided such information by the payment
              networks or your financial institutions. All Transactions are
              final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical
              problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your
              exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or
              refund of the price paid, as determined by BEACON HOSTELS. From
              time to time, BEACON HOSTELS may suspend or cancel payment or
              refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or
              unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles BEACON
              HOSTELS to a corresponding counterclaim.

              their owners are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality
              and security. BEACON HOSTELS will not be responsible for any
              losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account. Please
              contact BEACON HOSTELS help center if you suspect that your
              account has been compromised. You must be age 18 years and above
              to create an account and use our Services. BEACON HOSTELS IDs for
              persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal
              guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational
              institution. A parent or legal guardian who is creating an account
              for a minor should review this Agreement with the minor to ensure
              that they both understand it.

              Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected
              amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you

              change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may
              change the date on which you are billed for each period, as
              displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your
